# Pharmaceutical Data Project 
This project is based of screening for potential cancer treatments done on mice.
In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
With the use of the Python library Pandas , I cleaned mass data sets and created dataframes that focus on results of the drug regimins.
I then used Matplotlib to visualize results of medication effectiveness and tumor size among mice.
